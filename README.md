# WeatherStation
Weather Station records Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Elevation in a MariaDB hosted in a raspberry; 
the raw data are published via HTML by an Apache2 web server installed on the Raspberry. 
A real-Time dashboard is published as HTML directly from the ESP32 that acts as web server.
